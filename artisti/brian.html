         <h1>Brian Johnson</h1>
                <p>Brian Johnson (born 5 October 1947) is an English singer and songwriter who, since 1980, has been the lead singer for the Australian rock band AC/DC, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 along with the other members of the band.</p>
                
               <p>In 1972, Brian Johnson became one of the founding members of the glam rock band Geordie. After a few hit singles, including UK Top 10 "All Because Of You" (1973), the band split up in 1978 then to be reformed by Johnson in 1980. But after signing a new record deal, Johnson was asked to audition for AC/DC, whose charismatic frontman, Bon Scott, had died on February 19, 1980. Allegedly, a fan sent the band's management a tape of Johnson performing with Geordie although the band themselves have denied this. With the support of his bandmates in Geordie, and following advice from popular radio host James Whale, Brian Johnson joined AC/DC.</p>
                <p>Johnson's first album with AC/DC, Back in Black, is the second best selling album of all time, and the best selling album by any band.
                In 1997, Johnson recorded with the band Jackyl on their song "Locked and Loaded", and in 2002 wrote lyrics on the track "Kill the Sunshine" from their album Relentless.

                <h2>Early career</h2>
                <p>Johnson's first band was the Gobi Desert Canoe Club.[3] He was also in a band called Fresh.[4] From 1970, Johnson played with cabaret/club band The Jasper Hart Band,[5] performing songs from the musical Hair as well as soft-rock/pop songs of the time. He and other members of the band went on to form Geordie.</p>
                <p>The first and only solo single, "I Can't Forget You Now" Johnson released also as a member of Geordie in January 1976 on Red Bus label. In 1982, a compilation including only Geordie's 1973-1976 ten songs was issued as Brian Johnson's solo album Strange Man on the MCA label. The US 1989 CD Keep On Rocking, with re-recorded versions of the band's twelve known songs was released under the name of Brian Johnson & Geordie as well as the Australian 1991 compilation CD Rockin' With The Boys 1972-1976.</p>

                <h2>AC/DC</h2>
                <p>
                In March 1980 Johnson received a phone call inviting him to London to audition as the new vocalist for AC/DC. Their previous vocalist, Bon Scott, had died from an alcohol overdose on 19 February and the band wanted to continue. At the audition, Johnson sang the AC/DC song "Whole Lotta Rosie" and Ike & Tina Turner's "Nutbush City Limits".[2] In early April, Johnson was announced as the new vocalist of AC/DC.</p>
                <p>Back in Black, the first AC/DC album to feature Johnson, was released in July that year. It was a worldwide success and went on to become one of the best selling albums of all time. Their next album, 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute You also sold well. The raw, self-produced albums Flick of the Switch and Fly on the Wall were not as commercially successful as the previous two albums with Johnson. Who Made Who, released in 1986, was the soundtrack for the horror film Maximum Overdrive and brought back AC/DC's mainstream popularity.</p>
                <p>The 1988 album Blow Up Your Video was the last AC/DC album to feature lyrics from Johnson. Starting with 1990's The Razors Edge, guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young have written all of AC/DC's material. When asked by a fan during a radio interview why he stopped contributing lyrics, he laughed, "I ran out of words", and went on to explain that during recording, he didn't always enjoy the pressure of having to come up with an album's worth of lyrics and was relieved when the Young brothers filled in during The Razors Edge. The band has since continued in that tradition for every album since. In 2008, they released their tenth album with Johnson, Black Ice.[6]</p>
                <p>Brian Johnson customarily wears a cap on stage and frequently off. Originally, he wore a flat cap, once regarded as a symbol of his native Tyneside, but has occasionally worn baseball caps as well. His brother suggested that the singer wear the cap onstage to prevent sweat rolling off his thick, curly hair into his eyes while singing. "He said, 'Put it on, at least you'll be able to see what the bloody freak you're doing!' So I put it on and after three songs in the second set, I looked at him, put my thumbs up 'This is brilliant!' He never did get that hat back."</p>
                <p>In February 2010 during the Black Ice World Tour Johnson lashed out at a group of AC/DC fans who had written an open letter to the band asking for a change in the setlist, saying "Fuck them! What about the fans who haven't heard them? There are a few cocky fans. A lot of people now with the computers, they sit on their fat ass in their house somewhere going 'Oh they played that song last night, they should change it'. Well, bollocks to you. I don't think they realise changing a song in a set now is not the same as it used to be."[7]

                <h2>Helen of Troy musical</h2>
                <p>Since April 2003, Brian Johnson, who says "I love musical theatre, especially the classic stuff, like Rodgers and Hammerstein",[8] has been working on a musical version of Helen of Troy with Sarasota Ballet choreographer, Robert de Warren. The musical is a Les Miserables-style musical with rousing anthems, tender ballads and minimal dialogue. He conceived the project with writers Ian La Frenais, Dick Clement and Brendan Healy after seeing Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, Cats and being underwhelmed at what he saw.</p>
                <p>Malcolm McDowell, who made his recording debut singing one of the songs for the soundtrack in Brian's studio, has agreed to play Zeus. The Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan and Bruce Vilanch are also set to participate.[9]
                A small public performance, that featured songs written for the musical, was given in New York on June 13, 2005.
